# Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?
	
	I took this course because i wanted to further explore computer sciences as i find this topic very interesting. 
		
# What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features.

		I would say call of duty, however it can be buggy at times. I think apps such as instagram are interesting because they use AI and algorithms to collect information and find out every bit of information about you including tendencies. This is kinda scary but interesting at the same time. I want to manage to add interactive visual components into an application, such as on screen buttons for games.
